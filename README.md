# Simple Command-Line Shell

## Overview

This program implements a basic command-line shell that can execute Unix/Linux commands with support for input and output redirection. It reads commands from the user, 
parses them into tokens, and executes them in a child process. The shell supports redirection using "<" and ">", allowing users to manage input and output file streams.

## Features

- Execute Unix/Linux commands.
- Support for input redirection (<).
- Support for output redirection (>).
- Basic error handling for common issues.
- Dynamic memory management for command arguments and redirection filenames.
